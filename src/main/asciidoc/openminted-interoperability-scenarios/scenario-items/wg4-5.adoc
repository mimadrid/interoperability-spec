=== Scenario 5 -- Integration of a TDM workflow in a service/embedding in an application

==== Description

I, project manager, need a TDM workflow in order to provide TM/NLP functionality to the service we are developing.
Examples:

* A smart search function to a web site.
* The recommendation system of a vendor makes use of product descriptions and user reviews.
* A bioinformatics workflow for the annotation of a large genome includes the extraction of information from relevant papers.

==== Relevance to the WG

The developers need to know how to invoke the workflow when new input is provided and how to fetch the result of the
TDM analysis. They might require continuous processing of incoming text.

They will also require some level of robustness, the TDM should then be able to provide failure/recovery information.
Also they might want to get as many results as possible as soon as possible even if the whole workflow has not finished.

From the workflow design PoV, we assume in this scenario that the team includes one TDM professional. However they
might want to optimize the components according to specific criteria (storage, CPU usage, robustness, scalability).

==== Relevance to other WGs

* Resource MetaData (WG1): provenance, versioning, and licensing information might be critical in this scenario.
* Language Resources (WG2): low relevance.
* IPR and licensing (WG3): in this scenario the TDM workflow is part of a service that gives important context for WG3.

==== Relevance in general

Experience of deploying enterprise or end-user services that includes some level of TDM would be welcome.

==== Approaches

OpenMinTeD could specify a standard API to access workflows (parameters, LR), output (annotations, clusters,
classifiers), and status (running, fail).

==== Open questions

From experts:

* What kind of services are known to use TDM analyses?
* Which issues arise when deploying a workflow, what hinders the use and adoption of a workflow engine?

From WGs:

* From WG1: formal description of provenance, versioning, and licensing.
* From WG3: IPR issues in distributing or linking a workflow, and in distributing data processed by the workflow.
