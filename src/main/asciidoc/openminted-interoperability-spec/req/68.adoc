Linking elements from different schemas can be modelled in various ways. The most straightforward is the set of coarse grained lightweight thesaural mapping relations expressed by SKOS (https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/). This is our preferred linking approach, in combination with the following Owl and RDF object properties:  owl:sameAs, rdfs:subClassOf, and rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, and owl:equivalentProperty.
The compliance assessment checks the use of mentioned linking vocabularies within the KRs themselves, requesting an answer to the question: does the resource contain any of these links?
