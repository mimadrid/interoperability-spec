Version information must be included in the metadata of all resources. 

NOTE: At this point, we only wish to check whether versioning is represented in the metadata, and the recommended action can be to at least add the last update date; however, to ensure interoperability, we need to create guidelines for defining the notion of "version" for the same resource type and promote standardisation of its representation, at least per resource type; we also need to distinguish between versions of the metadata records and versions of the resources themselves

| Argo components have versions specified in both their POM and UIMA XML files, however these are usually not updated by developers, are not guaranteed to be synchronised and are not exploited by the Argo system.  For example, an Argo instance will only ever use the latest version of a component when executing a workflow.
