== Using/treating workflows as components

In order to incorporate an entire workflow (not only a single component) which may potentially be using a specific workflow engine/implementation or flow configuration that cannot be imported into my workflow editor of choice, it must be possible to treat the whole workflow as a component applying encapsulation and information hiding. However, it includes the ability to configure individual components in the workflow, e.g. by exposing these parameters as workflow parameters.

NOTE: Relevant approaches are e.g. the UIMA Aggregate Analysis Engines or GATE Applications.

|Product|Version|Compliant|Justification|Status

| Alvis
| 0.5rc
| Full
| The workflows are special components, they can be used in other workflows and Alvis offers means to handle the internal parameters.
| Draft

| ARGO
| 0.5
| No
| At present Argo doesn't allow this.  There is some support for this within the execution engine, however it hasn't been fully tested and changes within the UI will be required.  Current support within the execution engine would limit distribution of an embedded workflow to a single node, as there is no ability to distribute its components.
| Draft

| UIMA
| 2.8.1
| Full
| UIMA supports the concept of *aggregate analysis engines* whose delegates can be either primitive analysis engines or further aggregate engines. Aggregate engines may declare parameters whose values can be forwarded to delegates.
| Draft

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| N/A
| This is out of the scope of DKPro Core. See UIMA.
| Draft

| GATE
| 8.2
| Full
| In GATE every application is also a component allowing arbitrary nesting of applications.
| Draft

| ILSP
| 1.2.1
| Partial
| See UIMA for UIMA-based ILSP components.
